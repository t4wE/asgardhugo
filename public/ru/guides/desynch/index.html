Desynch Bug [Jodering]
</h1>
<div class= "text">
<p>Due to lack of skill, some players decided to ease the usage of buttons on their keyboard and created their own playstyle - jodering. It's simply desynching around all the map and spamming invisible Hammers, hoping some newbie will fly into them. They even examined the best ways to make desynch better (bumping into holes, etc.). So they created an illusion of skill in desynch usage. Like you must be experienced, so you can master this "technique" and make the desynch better.<br><br></p>

<p><br><strong>Thing is, jodering is gay.</strong></p>
<p>You better learn what <a href="/guides/swirls" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">swirls</a> thing is.</p>
<p>What you need to know is that by using Charge+Vigor we can fairly quickly move from one point to another with a slight desynch. This way we can dodge some missiles (Bone Spirit, Guided Arrow). So, in general, Charge+Vigor can be sometimes useful in HvB, HvD, HvZ, and HvN.</p>
<p>In reality, mastering this technique isn't something you should do, however, you should know about it. In some duels against casters, an unexpected desynch ahead of their way and a couple of Hammers (randoms/invis ones) can be unexpected for the opponent.</p>
