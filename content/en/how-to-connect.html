<p>Step 1</p>
<hr />
<p>Install Diablo II and Lord of Destruction Expansion.</p>
<hr />
<p>Step 2</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Our server requires version 1.14d. If you already have 1.14d, then just skip further to step 3. If you have version 1.13d or less - you got two options:</p>
<p>
	<em>Option #1</em>
</p>
<p>
	Our server has an automatic update till version 1.14d. So you can just download our
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=1uiEPp6MkNFN3Tj_ZjnZ2c4seVwEcfrgE&amp;export=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reg file</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Add the server's info to the registry. Close all other d2 windows, launch game as Administrator<em>(if you won't do that, the update might crash and the message will say "unable to identify application version" - watch <a href="#ref1">ref #1</a> in that case)</em>, and connect to Asgard. The game will be updated till 1.14d.<br>
	Now you can skip further to step 4.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Option #2</em>
</p>
<p>
	Install the patch manually. Download official
	<a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a>.
	Run it. If the update was successful, skip to step 3.<br>
	The problem might appear if you have multiple folders of Diablo II. The patch might start installing into the wrong folder. To avoid that, you need to download
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=1bcOCMcdadPi_ff05wLMpnTUAUDVg_4TN&amp;export=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LodRepair.exe</a>.
	Run it. Choose your game folder and push the "Apply Path" button. Now any patch will be installed into the folder you just chose. Install
	<a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a>
	again. <br>
	If you still have a problem <em>(invalid game version)</em> - watch <a href="#ref1">ref #1</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Step 3</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Download
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=1uiEPp6MkNFN3Tj_ZjnZ2c4seVwEcfrgE&amp;export=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reg file</a>.<br>
	<em>(<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=1AFhantad_4D5-2bvLeyUoxmbuKqDLCHF&amp;export=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>&lt;---- for Russian players)</em><br>
	Double click it. Add the server's gateway into the registry.<br>
	If you are using Battle.net Gateway Editor: IP Address: bnet.minimoo.eu<br>
	Zone: 8<br>
	If you have done everything right, Asgard will appear in the list of your servers and you will be able to easily swap between Eu/East and Asgard. <br>

<hr />
<p>Step 4</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Create a game account via the <a href="/create-account" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">web link</a>
</p>
<p>
	<font size="+2">Account registration through the game client is disabled!</font>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Remember, that your password should be maximum of 12 symbols long!<br>
		Sometimes there is a bug when the password you chose will appear incorrect when trying to enter it in the game (usually happens when your password contains symbols other than Latin letters or numbers). <a href="/contacts" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">Contact</a> us and we will fix it.</em>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Step 5</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Connect to the server and choose Asgard realm from the list of realms (<em>upper right corner of characters menu</em>).
</p>
<img src="/images/realm.png" alt="realm" />
<hr />
<p>Step 6</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Our server has three hosts:
	<ul>
		<li>Moscow</li>
		<li>London</li>
		<li>New York</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<img src="/images/servers.png" alt="servers" />
<p>
	The message of the day names the host where the game is created. Keep creating games until it is the server you want. Usually takes 3-4 tries.</p>
<hr />
<p>Step 7</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Create your character, make items via <a href="/cube-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cube recipes</a> or <a href="/mod-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-game accounts</a>. Enjoy your duels!

<p>
	If you are having any problems with your game's version (<em>invalid game version</em>) install <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=1bcOCMcdadPi_ff05wLMpnTUAUDVg_4TN&amp;export=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LodRepair.exe</a>. Run it. Choose your game folder. Push the "Apply path" button. Push "Start Update". This will reset your game's version to clear 1.07(<em>iirc</em>). After that install <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a> again.
</p>
<p>
	If you are still <u>somehow</u> having problems with your game's version - that means something is basically wrong with your Diablo 2 game files. You better just re-install it.
