<h2>
    Step 1
</h2>
<p>
    Install Diablo II and Lord of Destruction Expansion.
</p>
<h2>
    Step 2
</h2>
<p>
    Our server requires version 1.14d. If you already have 1.14d, then just skip further to step 3. If you have version 1.13d or less, you have two options:
</p>
<p>
    <h3>
        Option #1
    </h3>
</p>
<p>
    Our server has an automatic update untill version 1.14d. So you can just download our
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1uiEPp6MkNFN3Tj_ZjnZ2c4seVwEcfrgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reg file</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Add the server's info to the registry. Close all other d2 windows, launch the game as Administrator<em>(if you won't do that, the update might crash and the message will say "unable to identify application version" - watch <a href="#ref1">ref #1</a> in that case)</em>, and connect to Asgard. The game will be updated untill 1.14d.<br>
    Now you can skip further to step 4.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>
        Option #2
    </h3>
</p>
<p>
    Install the patch manually. Download the official
    <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a>.
    Run it. If the update was successful, skip to #step 3.<br>
    The problem might appear if you have multiple folders of Diablo II. The patch might start installing in the wrong folder. To avoid that, you need to download
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bcOCMcdadPi_ff05wLMpnTUAUDVg_4TN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LodRepair.exe</a>.
    Run it. Choose your game folder and push the "Apply Path" button. Now, any patch will be installed in the folder you just chose. Install
    <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a>
    again. <br>
    If you still have a problem <em>(invalid game version)</em>, watch <a href="#ref1">ref #1</a>
</p>
<h2>
    Step 3
</h2>
<p>
    Download the
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1uiEPp6MkNFN3Tj_ZjnZ2c4seVwEcfrgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reg file</a>.<br>
    <em>(<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1AFhantad_4D5-2bvLeyUoxmbuKqDLCHF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>&lt;---- for Russian players)</em><br>
    Double click it. Add the server's gateway into the registry.<br>
    If you are using Battle.net Gateway Editor: IP Address: bnet.minimoo.eu<br>
    Zone: 8<br>
    If you have done everything right, Asgard will appear in the list of your servers, and you will be able to easily swap between Eu/East and Asgard. <br>
</p>

<h2>
    Step 4
</h2>
<p>
    Create a game account via the <a href="/create-account" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">weblink</a>
</p>
<p style="font-size:25px">
    Account registration through the game client is disabled!
</p>
<p>
    <em>Remember that your password should be a maximum of 12 symbols long!<br>
        Sometimes there is a bug when the password you chose will appear incorrect when trying to enter it in the game (usually happens when your password contains symbols other than Latin letters or numbers). <a href="/contacts" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">Contact</a> us, and we will fix it.</em>
</p>
<h2>
    Step 5
</h2>
<p>
    Connect to the server and choose the Asgard realm from the list of realms (<em>upper right corner of characters menu</em>).
</p>
<img src="/images/realm.webp" alt="realm" / width="548" height="410">
<h2>
    Step 6
</h2>
<p>
    Our server has three hosts:
    <ul>
        <li>Moscow</li>
        <li>London</li>
        <li>New York</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<img src="/images/servers.webp" alt="servers" / width="448" width="282">
<p>
    The message of the day names the host where the game is created. Keep creating games until you get the server you want. It usually takes 3-4 tries.
</p>
<h2>
    Step 7
</h2>
<p>
    Create your character, make items via <a href="/cube-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cube recipes</a> or <a href="/mod-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-game accounts</a>. Enjoy your duels!

<p>
    If you are having any problems with your game's version (<em>invalid game version</em>), install <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bcOCMcdadPi_ff05wLMpnTUAUDVg_4TN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LodRepair.exe</a>. Run it. Choose your game folder. Push the "Apply path" button. Push "Start Update". This will reset your game's version to clear 1.07(<em>iirc</em>). After that, install <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch 1.14d</a> again.
</p>
<p>
    If you are still <u>somehow</u> having problems with your game's version, that means something is basically wrong with your Diablo 2 game files. You better just reinstall it.
