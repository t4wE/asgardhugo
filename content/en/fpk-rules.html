<p>
    FPK - are certain dueling rules where four characters (Assassin, Barbarian, Necromancer, Druid) play by them.
</p>
<p>
    These FPK rules are made and adjusted specifically for Asgard PvP Realm. If the game has a "fpk" prefix (e.g."fpk duels"), then don't be a jerk and obey them - otherwise, you might be kicked out of the game by one of the moderators. Continuous disobeying might lead to a temp/perm ban.
