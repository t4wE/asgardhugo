        Beforehand
    </h2>
    <p>
        For those in the tank (boomers?): there's an excellent remaster called<a href="https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/"> Diablo 2: Resurrected </a> (~20 euros) based on the game Diablo 2. Everything here is cool and wonderful. Some PvP mechanics are not fully transferred, but in general, everything is very cool. If you want to "remember" the game of your childhood, then do not spare 20 euros and check it out. Pay attention to the requirements, you need a relatively modern PC, otherwise you ll have 10 fps.
    </p>
    <pre>
Operating System     Windows® 10
Processor            Intel® Core i3-3250/AMD FX-4350
Video                Nvidia GTX 660/AMD Radeon HD 7850
Memory               8 GB RAM
Storage              30 GB
Internet             Broadband Internet connection
Resolution           1280 x 720

    <p>
        <u>MOREOVER:</u> <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> (~100 euros) came out not so long ago. Ratings are excellent, the game is atmospheric, you can feel the vibe of Diablo 2. However, not only the price tag is huge, but so are the requirements. In general, if your computer is powerful and the money is not an issue, you might try this as well.
    </p>
    <pre>

    <p>
        I won't say anything about <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> (~40 euros). I didn't like it, it's a bit anime-like, for zoomers, not my cup of tea.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">
    Lets Go!
</h2>
<p>
    If you r still reading this article, then you v passed the test for a traditional orientation, which means that you, like all normal people, are a loyal in your soul to Diablo 2.
</p>
<p>
    So next I will make some classification of servers, point out the advantages and disadvantages of each, and it would be up to you to decide where you want to play.
</p>
<p>
    Also if i wont bee too lazy, I'll try to make and keep everything up to date in the <a style="font-size:30px" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RDB1PoxTZPFjVAWu17yFwely3R3t3YAsx2RJ6Rs4Ouw/" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">google spreadsheet</a>. For suggestions/changes to the table lmk <a href="/contacts" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">somewhere here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    All servers can be divided into:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Official</li>
    <li> Unofficial</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">
    Official
</h2>
<p>
    These are well-known to you Europe/US West/US East/Asia. These are official servers. Ya need to buy a CD-Key to play here for two games: D2 и D2: LoD. Each costs about 15$, 30$ total.
</p>
<p>
    Reset: at the end of May and end of October.
</p>
<p>
    Online: high.
</p>
<p>
    PvM: due to tons of bots that give you BO, Enchant, and even level up themselves PvM is kinda boring, but it's up to you to decide whether to use bots or not. Lately, there was a ban-wave so a lot of guys quit using them.
</p>
<p>
    UPDATE (Dec 2017): Recently there was a ban wave. Now there are literally no bots. Items now have value they never had before. Say, Ber costs 2k fg at the season start.
</p>
<p>
    PvP: High-lvl-pvp takes place in NL. Thanks to huge online players skill vary from total newbies to world's tier 1 players. by using bots you can make a duelable character in a pretty short time. Could take a couple of months but it would be free. It's also possible to make a char by using <a href="http://forums.d2jsp.org/buyGold.php" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">real money</a> on <a href="http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=54" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">d2jsp</a> (takes ~30$).If you will have ping issues - you can install <a class="bbc_url" href="http://www.battleping.com/" rel="nofollow external">Battle Ping</a> to reduce ping to playable values.
</p>
<p>
    Trade: in-game or on <a href="https://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=54" rel="alternate">d2jsp</a>. Simple things like Shako/Mara can be purchased in 2-3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:green;">Pros:</span> huge online, easy trade, good PvP skill level on NL.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:red;">Cons:</span> bots; requires payment. Chars expire after 90 days of inactivity. Don't mix with Reset, when characters are just moved to NL.
</p>
<p>
    Host: France.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Install:</b> buy CD-Key <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii" rel="alternate">D2</a> and <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction" rel="alternate">D2: LoD</a>. Download game client via <a href="https://eu.battle.net/account/management/download/" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">Battle.net</a>: D2 and D2: LoD. Start installing and use bought CD Keys when asked.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">
    Unofficial
</h2>
<p>
    It is all the remaining servers. They, in their turn, are divided into those, who need a mod to be installed (new items/skills/locations) and ones that don't, official-like (no mod needs to be installed).
    <ul>
        <li>No mods</li>
        <li>Mods</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">
    No mods
</h2>
<p>
    Probably only 3 servers here that I know:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://forums.playground.ru/diablo_2/" rel="alternate">Playground.ru</a></li>
    <li>

    <li>
        <a href="/" rel="alternate">Asgard</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
    PG
</h3>
<p>
    It's a monopolist among all Russian servers - <a class="bbc_url" href="http://forums.playground.ru/diablo_2/" rel="nofollow external">Playground.ru</a>. About 90% of all Russian players hang out here.
</p>
<p>
    Reset: once in 2-3 years.
</p>
<p>
    Online: 300-500~.
</p>
<p>
    PvM: really low drop rate ( v 1.11), so making a character takes years, and runes above Sur is a privilege. There is also a monopoly on Annihiluses.
</p>
<p>
    PvP: very poor conditions cause 1.11 drop
</p>
<p>
    Trade: poor. either in-game or on the forum or in VK group
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:green;">Pros:</span> mother-Russian-server
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:red;">Cons:</span> everything else :D lots of invisible changes that you need to guess on your own. Also no 50% dr cap, enchanted MA, multiple windows drop after a certain amount of time. In fact, this server can be assigned to mod one. It isn't there just technically.

    <a href="https://www.median-xl.com/">Median XL</a> deserves special attention here. It is probably the only one that is still supported. All other mods are relics of the past. Modifications: <a href="https://www.median-xl.com/"> here </a>, there is also a "Download" button.
</p>
<p>
    There are also many other, <a href="http://www.diablo1.ru/diablo2mods/" rel="alternate">fan-made</a> amateur mods/mini-mods. (for the link I do not vouch, there may be viruses, at your own risk)
