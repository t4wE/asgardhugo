<p>The name of the C/T Trick comes from the default binds that are used for this technique.</p>
<p>C — Character Screen</p>
<p>T— Skill Tree</p>
<p><em>Of course, these binds should be changed. Personally, I have them as follows: "A" — CS, S — ST, but&nbsp;when playing&nbsp;Hdin I am lack of available binds, so I had to bind</em><em>&nbsp;Fanaticism on "T", which is not very convenient. One of my friend's&nbsp;binds are&nbsp;as follows: "C" — CS and B — ST. So think of the binds yourself, so they would be comfortable for you.</em></p>
<p>The&nbsp;thing with this trick is that when you open certain game screens (Character screen and Skill Tree) we can increase the radius (more like the rectangle)&nbsp;of skills like Teleport and Lightning Sentry. Works&nbsp;with other skills as well, but unlike TP and LS they don't do much impact in the duel.</p>
<p>When pressing "C" (opening a CS) and using TP&nbsp;at the edge (the corner) of the screen, its length increases in half (length from right to left. the height does not increase).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is the beginning of the Teleport of Paladin and the distance at which you can stomp by pressing the Teleport&nbsp;at the left edge of the screen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Now press TP at the edge of the screen when you opened CS.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">That much more we have overflowed rather then we used normal&nbsp;TP</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/ct3.png" alt="ct3"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a comparison. As I said, is roughly 1.5x&nbsp;more.<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;">Also here&nbsp;a&nbsp;comparison of how farther can you TP by using C/T trick when doing 1(2) TP's.</p>

<p>It is also worth&nbsp;mentioning that when using C/T in the upper right (left) corner, the angle changes. White line ~parallel to the edge of the map. So, when you normally teleport in the right corner of the screen you will move left on&nbsp;to the line, and if C/T&nbsp;- slightly to the right.<br>

<p>By using C/T you can overrun your opponent even though your enemy has a higher breakpoint on TP, but he isn't using C/T. In this video Assassin (102fcr — 9 frames TP) is using C/T&nbsp;and overruns Necro (125fcr — 8 frames TP) who uses regular TP.</p>

<p>C/T is a very useful trick when playing as an Assassin&nbsp;and setting traps. Traps will be&nbsp;set 1.5x farther! Sometimes a Nec&nbsp;won't even expect that there are already traps set ahead of his way.</p>

<p>Go for it! In the beginning, I was all confused too. Either I opened&nbsp;a wrong window or forgot to close one. After a month, I had much of a progress. The confusion became less frequent. After 2-3 months&nbsp;I already made the trick automatically.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that you should try to do every TP or Traps by using C/T. That way you will definitely get confused at some point (might be lethal).&nbsp;With some experience, you will know when you need to use C/T and when you don't. It is mainly used to catch someone up/quickly fly away/quickly fly and make unexpected stomp/to set traps on the&nbsp;way of a Necro (where he doesn't expect them to be or&nbsp;ahead of the way of a possible IBS).</p>
<p>It's also useful to use C/T to spam Teeth (the flow of the Teeth will be more concentrated and will likely cause more damage).</p>
