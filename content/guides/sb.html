<p>The thing with this trick is a visual display of&nbsp;one skill, while you are actually using another.</p>

<p>In this case, Sorc is actually using Inferno, but Frozen Orb is displayed instead with FPA (Frames Per Attack)&nbsp;of Inferno. When performing Skill Bug all characters (except Paladin and Barbarian) do it while standing in&nbsp;one spot.</p>
<p>How does that help us in PvP, since it is&nbsp;just a "visual indulgence"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trick&nbsp;becomes useful with Paladin, the visual display of Blessed Hammer&nbsp;instead of Charge (and his FPA). It will look something like this:</p>

<p>Due to the fact that, after all, it's still a Bug, when we are Charging wear are really moving in a way (we don't stand in one spot). After running a short distance, we can make&nbsp;an unexpected stomp. It works somewhere in&nbsp; 2~ game screen from where you&nbsp;started the bug. For the opponent, it would look like stomp from nowhere.</p>

<p>Actually, this can be perceived as a <a href="/guides/desynch" rel="alternate">Desynch</a>. And, indeed, in theory, if you do the Charge+Vigor thing right and stumble&nbsp;at some holes, you can get something very similar. But then we will never be sure how good the desynch is, whether we&nbsp;froze in one place, or just moving around with a big delay on the screen of the opponent. The opponent can&nbsp;guess&nbsp;your pathway and attack us.&nbsp;So, in the end, it might end badly for us.</p>
<p>The thing with a Skill Bug is that we&nbsp;are 100% sure we froze on opponent's mini-map. Besides, we can't receive damage while we&nbsp;sprint to the opponent.&nbsp;During this time we are kinda ~immune to missiles. The danger may lie when your enemy caught you just the moment you performed SB. If he attacks you at that same moment, the damage&nbsp;will be received and your "true" location will be revealed. Personally, in my practice, that never happened. If the opponent flew to you it is a good opportunity for stomping him. Simply don't panic and just instantly stomp him first.</p>
<p>So, how to perform this bug?</p>
<p>Blessed Hammer on the left skill bar of CtA. Charge on the Hoto's left skill bar. Start Charging around. Right after click Swap &gt; Swap+Hammer (bind on the left panel)&gt;Shift (Stand Still). For Example: "R" &gt; "R" + "Q" &gt; "Shift".</p>

<p>Swap &gt; Swap+Hammer &gt;Shift is pressed quickly and clearly with the same frequency. Re-watch the video again and turn&nbsp;the sound louder in order to understand the frequency with which you need to perform this combination. It (the frequency) is approximately* equal.</p>
<p>*perhaps slightly belated Shift, as if the delay between the Swap &gt; Swap+Hammer is 10 units, then Shift-click&nbsp;cam be done 12 to 14&nbsp;units after the second swap</p>
<p>The indicator that you are Skille bugged will be that fact that your mana will no longer drain. Also, you will&nbsp;be returning back to the place where you&nbsp;started the bug (if you ran too far). There either won't be a sound of casting Hammer or it will be halfway "interrupted":</p>
<p>Run &gt; Swap &gt; Swap+Hammer &gt;Shift</p>
<p>Mana is not draining, then we are in the Bug. We are charging to the opponent (or wait, till he comes to you). Stomp him.</p>
<p>Try it. After a couple of evenings (with some rest ofc, but&nbsp;totally about two hours per day), you should be already able to do it "over time". Soon your fingers will get used to that timing and will do everything&nbsp;mechanically and soon you will find a good application for this trick. Try to use it in regular PvP, but not too often. Anyway, trying it will take only a few seconds. If&nbsp;you failed (mana is draining), just continue your duel.</p>
<hr>
<p>The second&nbsp;helpful usage of this trick comes with a Barbarian. We bug WW to Zerk. So while we stand in one spot on opponent's mini-map, we actually WW closer to him. That way we can make an unexpected lock while being two game screens away.</p>

<p>Good Luck and Have Fun!</p>
